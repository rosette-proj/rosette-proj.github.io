### rosette-server

Back in the components section, I described briefly how to stand up an instance of rosette-server. The server's main goal is to give you programmatic access to your Rosette system via an API. Once your server is up and running, you should be able to visit [http://localhost:9292/v1/swagger_doc](http://localhost:9292/v1/swagger_doc) to see a list of all available API endpoints:

{% highlight json linenos=table %}
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "swaggerVersion": "1.2",
  "produces": ["application/json"],
  "apis": [
    {
      "path": "/extractors.{format}",
      "description": "Information about configured extractors."
    },{
      "path": "/git.{format}",
      "description": "Perform various git-insipired operations on phrases and translations"
    },{
      "path": "/translations.{format}",
      "description": "Perform various operations on translations"
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

The most interesting parts here are the 'git' and 'translations' sections. To see more information about git-based operations, visit [http://localhost:9292/v1/swagger_doc/git](http://localhost:9292/v1/swagger_doc/git). Here's a snippet of what you should see:

{% highlight json linenos=table %}
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "swaggerVersion": "1.2",
  "resourcePath": "/git",
  "produces": ["application/json"],
  "apis": [
    {
      "path": "/v1/git/commit.{format}",
      "operations": [
        {
          "notes": "",
          "summary": "Extract phrases from a commit and store them in the datastore.",
          "nickname": "GET--version-git-commit---format-",
          "method": "GET",
          "parameters": [
            {
              "paramType": "query",
              "name": "repo_name",
              "description": "The name of the repository to examine.
                Must be configured in the current Rosette config.",
              "type": "string",
              "required": true,
              "allowMultiple": false
            },{
              "paramType": "query",
              "name": "ref",
              "description": "The git ref to commit phrases from.
                Can be either a git symbolic ref (i.e. branch name) or a git commit id.",
              "type": "string",
              "required": true,
              "allowMultiple": false
            }
          ],
          "type": "void"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "basePath": "http://localhost:9292"
}
{% endhighlight %}

### rosette-client

Great, your server is working. Time now to interact with it a little. The [rosette-client](https://github.com/rosette-proj/rosette-client) gem will allow you to do just that. This gem is capable of making API calls to a running instance of rosette-server and nicely printing the results. You can either add rosette-client as a dependency of another project and use it to make API calls by hand, or install it with rubygems and use it via the command line.

The command line version installs an executable named git-rosette that you can use inside git repositories. To set up rosette-client, create a file at `~/.rosette/config.yml` (in your home directory). It should have the following contents:

{% highlight yaml linenos=table %}
:host: localhost  # assuming you're running rosette-server locally
:port: 9292
:version: v1
{% endhighlight %}

Next, install rosette-client by executing `gem install rosette-client`. If you installed JRuby with rbenv, don't forget to run `rbenv rehash` to make the git-rosette executable available on your path.

Finally, change directory into your git repository, commit a few nonsense phrases, and run `git rosette commit`. If everything is configured properly, you should see something like this:

{% highlight console linenos=table %}
Added: 2
Removed: 0
Modified: 0
{% endhighlight %}

Now that you have some phrases committed, you should be able to run `git rosette show`:

{% highlight console linenos=table %}
diff --rosette a/config/locales/en.yml b/config/locales/en.yml
+ testing test (my_app.header.foobar)
+ purple eggplants (my_app.testing.megazork)
{% endhighlight %}
