### Repos and Extractors

In the previous section, I described how to configure a repository and add an extractor to it. Let's go over each line in some detail.

First, we add a repository by calling the `#add_repo` method:

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
config.add_repo('my_awesome_repo') do |repo_config|
{% endhighlight %}

`#add_repo` yields a repo configuration object and takes a string argument that semantically identifies the repo. This repo name doesn't really mean anything to Rosette - it's only used to uniquely identify the repo. That said, it's a good idea to use name of your repository here, since rosette-client will use it when making API calls. For example, if your repository is on disk at `/path/to/my_awesome_repo`, then you should use 'my_awesome_repo' as the repo name.

Next, we tell Rosette where to find the repo on disk and give it a semantic description:

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
repo_config.set_path('/path/to/workspace/my_awesome_repo/.git')
repo_config.set_description('A bowl of awesomeness')
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the path you specify should point to your repo's .git directory.

Finally, we add an extractor to the repo. As described above, extractors are responsible for reading and parsing files that contain translatable content:

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
repo_config.add_extractor('yaml/rails') do |ext_config|
  ext_config.set_conditions do |cond|
    cond.match_path('config/locales/en.yml')
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

In the same way `#add_repo` yields a repo configuration object, so does `#add_extractor` yield an extractor configuration object. Here we use the `#set_conditions` method to tell the extractor which files it should read and parse. Any of the files in the repository that match these conditions will have their phrases extracted and recorded in the configured datastore (for a full list of matchers, see rosette-core's [yard docs](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rosette-proj/rosette-core), specifically [this](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rosette-proj/rosette-core/Rosette/Core/ExtractorConfigurationFactory/Node)).

You can chain matchers using `#and` and `#or` to build sets of complex matching rules. For example, if my Rails app also has an [engine](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) named 'cart' that has its own translations, I might configure the extractor like this:

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
repo_config.add_extractor('yaml/rails') do |ext_config|
  ext_config.set_conditions do |cond|
    cond.match_path('config/locales/en.yml').or(
      cond.match_path('cart/config/locales/en.yml')
    )
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

### Serializers and Pre-Processors

Extractors handle pulling strings out of your repository, but eventually you'll need to write translations back out to files. That's what serializers are for. Serializers handle the process of converting the translation entries in Rosette's datastore to files your application can read and make use of. For a Rails app for example, we need to be able to serialize Spanish translations into the file at `config/locales/es.yml`.

Let's configure a Rails yaml serializer for our repo:

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
require 'rosette/serializers/yaml-serializer'
repo_config.add_serializer('rails', format: 'yaml/rails')
{% endhighlight %}

That's really all we have to do. Serializers optionally yield a serializer configuration object that we can use to configure pre-processors. Pre-processors modify translation text before it gets serialized and written. For example, I might want to normalize my translations using the [Unicode normalization algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence) (in short, a process by which characters are "fixed" so they're all consistently represented).

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
require 'rosette/preprocessors/normalization-preprocessor'
ser_config.add_preprocessor('normalization') do |pre_config|
  pre_config.set_normalization_form(:nfc)
end
{% endhighlight %}

### Datastores and Caches

Up until this point, we haven't configured a way for Rosette to store phrases and translations. To do so, we'll go back to the top-level and add one using the `#use_datastore` method. Rosette expects the datastore to be implementation independent - in other words, Rosette doesn't care how the datastore actually works under the hood.  All that's required is that the datastore conform to a well-defined datastore interface.

In our examples here, we're going to use a datastore backed by [ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html), the data access layer provided by Rails. Support for ActiveRecord comes in the form of the rosette-active-record gem, and we can configure it like this:

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
require 'rosette/data_stores/active_record_data_store'
config.use_datastore(
  'active-record', {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 3306,
    username: 'myname'
    password: 'secretsecret',
    adapter: 'jdbcmysql',
    database: 'rosette',
    encoding: 'utf8',
    pool: 16
  }
)
{% endhighlight %}

For this example, you'll also need to add the `activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter` gem to your gemfile. Since Rosette runs on top of JRuby, you'll need to always use a JDBC-based adapter if you want to use rosette-active-record.

Next, let's configure a cache. Configuring a cache can help Rosette's performance. Under the hood, Rosette uses `ActiveSupport::Cache`, so you'll need to choose one of the caches it supports. In this example, we'll use [memcached](http://memcached.org/) via the [dalli gem](https://github.com/mperham/dalli):

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
config.use_cache(:dalli_store, namespace: 'whatever', compress: true)
{% endhighlight %}

### Integrations

Integrations provide a mechanism for adding support for 3rd-party services to your Rosette configuration. For example, you may want to add an integration for the translation management system you've selected (like [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) or [Smartling](http://www.smartling.com/)). In our example, we're going to show how to integrate with [Rollbar](http://rollbar.com), an error reporting service. We'd like to report extraction errors as well as anything else that might go wrong to help us track down and fix bugs:

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
require 'rollbar'

notifier = Rollbar::Notifier.new.tap do |notifier|
  notifier.configure do |c|
    c.access_token = 'secretsecret'
    c.environment = 'production'
    c.logger = Rosette.logger
    c.enabled = true
  end
end

require 'rosette/integrations/rollbar_integration'

config.add_integration('rollbar') do |rollbar_config|
  rollbar_config.set_rollbar_notifier(notifier)
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now, any errors caught by Rosette will be sent to Rollbar.
